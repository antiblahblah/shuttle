## [1.2.7] - 2016-07-24
### Added
- Now that iTerm stable is at version 3, the version 2 applescripts no longer apply to the stable branch. shuttle still supports iTerm 2.14. If you still want to use this legacy version you will have to change your iTerm_version setting to legacy. Valid settings are:

```"iTerm_version": "legacy",``` targeting iTerm 2.14

```"iTerm_version": "stable",``` targeting new versions of iTerm

```"iTerm_version": "nightly",``` targeting only the nightly build of iTerm

Please make sure to change your shuttle.JSON file accordingly. For more on this see #181

### Fixed 
- corrected by @mortonfox -- when iTerm startup preferences are set to "Don't Open Any Windows" nothing happens #175.
- corrected by @pluwen shuttle icon contains unwanted artifacts #141
- Fixed an issue where commas were not getting parsed #173

## [1.2.6] - 2016-02-24
### Added
- added by @keesfransen -- ssh config file parsing only keeps the first alias. This change keeps the menu clean as it only keeps the first argument to Host and will allow for hosts defined like:
```
Host prod/host host.prod
    HostName myserver.local
```
- Added the script files that compile the applescript files for inclusion in shuttle.app

### Fixed 
- corrected by @mortonfox -- when iTerm stable is running but no windows are open nothing happens.
- iTerm Stable and Terminal apple scripts were not correctly handling events where the app was open but no windows were open.
- Fixed an issue were iTerm Nightly applescripts would not open if a theme was not set.
- Fixed an issue with the URL detection. shuttle checks the command to see if its a URL then opens that URL in the default app.
Example:
```
"cmd": "cifs://myServer/c$"
```
Should open the above path in finder.

## [1.2.5] - 2015-11-05
